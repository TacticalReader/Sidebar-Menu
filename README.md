# Sidebar-Menu
Certainly! The provided code appears to be the foundation for a responsive sidebar project for a web application or dashboard. Here's a brief description:

**Project Overview**
**1. Purpose:**
   The project aims to create a responsive web dashboard with a sidebar navigation menu, catering to users, especially web developers, managing various aspects of their application or website.

**2. Key Features:**
   - **Responsive Design:** The sidebar and content are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
   - **Sidebar Navigation:** The sidebar provides a navigation menu with categorized sections, facilitating easy access to different functionalities.
   - **User Information:** The sidebar includes a section displaying user details, such as the user's role, name, and profile image.
   - **Dropdown Menus:** Dropdown menus within the navigation allow for nested options, enhancing the organization of content.
   - **Toggle Button:** A toggle button is implemented to expand or collapse the sidebar, optimizing space when needed.

**3. Styling:**
   - The project uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look.
   - The color scheme includes a primary background color of `#5b6677` for the body, with a white sidebar background (`#fff`).
   - Stylish icons from different icon libraries (Phosphor Icons, Photon Icons, and Ionicons) enhance visual appeal.

**4. JavaScript Interactivity:**
   - The JavaScript code, using jQuery, manages the behavior of the sidebar and its interaction with the user.
   - Clicking on a menu item toggles its active state, expands or collapses its associated submenu, and closes other open submenus.
